MLP Activation Functions — Tutorial & Experiments

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial and experimental analysis on how different activation functions influence the learning performance of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The study compares four activation functions provided by scikit-learn: identity, logistic, tanh, and relu.

Using the scikit-learn Digits dataset, the experiments evaluate each activation function under a fixed architecture and preprocessing pipeline. The objective is to illustrate how activation choices impact model expressiveness, convergence behavior, and classification accuracy.
